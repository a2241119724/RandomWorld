# Job Lifecycle

Read this for live PixelLab calls that return a job, asset ID, managed MCP asset, pending status, review status, rate-limit response, or download URL.

## Polling

REST v2 async jobs normally use `GET /background-jobs/{job_id}` when the create response returns a background job ID. Vocal animation is the explicit exception: poll `GET /vocal-animation/{job_id}`. MCP managed assets use the matching `get_*` tool, not REST background-job polling.

MCP tilesets (`create_topdown_tileset` → `get_topdown_tileset`) have no such 423/404 window — the getter reports progress directly. For REST `POST /v2/tilesets`, the create response can contain both `background_job_id` and `tileset_id` while the status is still `processing`. Poll `GET /background-jobs/{background_job_id}` first. `GET /tilesets/{tileset_id}` may return `423` while the tileset is still being generated, or `404` until the background job has completed and the tileset object has been persisted; treat those as early lifecycle lookups while the background job is still processing.

Poll gently: a short initial delay, then back off — not tight loops. A paid async result is already bought, so do not stop while it is merely still running — follow SKILL.md step 12's poll → background-wait → handoff ladder. Stop before "done" only for a real blocker: failure, auth/credit error, or a needed user choice such as review selection.

Any wait that runs outside the current turn — a backgrounded poll loop, a log/file watcher, a scheduled wake — must be bounded to return control on success, failure or terminal error, and a hard deadline, never on success alone, and must emit a terminal marker on every path so the harness can always wake you. A background `until <success>; do sleep; done` loop (or a `tail -f … | grep <success>` watcher) never exits when the job fails or stalls, so nothing ever wakes you. On resuming from any wait, re-fetch actual status with the status route or getter before acting — the wait ending is not proof of success — and if the deadline passed with the job still pending, do not wait again: fall back to reporting the ID and resume route above.

Do not resubmit a paid job because a poll timed out or a `423`/`404`/`review`/stale-URL lookup came back — poll again or re-fetch with the matching getter instead.

Detect completion by the result, not by matching a status word: `status` is a free-form string whose in-progress vocabulary is open and endpoint-specific (`processing`, `pending`, `running`, `finalizing`, … — not a fixed set), and the tileset family carries no `status` field at all. Check in this order:

- **Done** — the result payload is present: the asset/image/download/rotation URL is populated (e.g. a character's `rotation_urls` is null until done), or a tileset-family getter returns HTTP 200 (see the 423/404 note above). Verify the URL or local download.
- **Failed** — `status: "failed"` or HTTP 410 (permanent). Report it; do not retry paid work unless the user approves.
- **Review** — `status: "review"` (objects): selection is required; do not call it completed.
- **Otherwise keep polling** — any in-progress status word, HTTP 423/404, or a value you do not recognize — bounded by a deadline (below). Never treat "the status isn't a word I listed" as done.

## MCP Managed Assets

MCP creation tools return asset IDs quickly. Use the matching getter to inspect status, previews, downloads, and results:

- Characters: `get_character`.
- Character animations: `get_character` or animation-specific tool output when available.
- Objects: `get_object`.
- Map objects: `get_map_object`.
- Fonts: `get_font`.
- Portrait-character conversions: `get_portrait_character`.
- Vocal animations: `get_vocal_animation`; partial visemes may appear before completion, so wait for the terminal result.
- Raw-image jobs (`create_image_pixflux`/`create_image_pixen`/`create_image_pro`, `edit_image`, `inpaint_image`, `animate_image` — none need a managed asset): `get_image`, the one shared getter for the whole family.
- UI assets, tilesets, tiles, projects, or helpers: use the visible matching MCP getter when exposed.

State tools such as `create_character_state` and `create_object_state` auto-wait only briefly for the source asset to finish. If a state call fails because the source is still pending, poll the source with its getter first, then retry the state call only when the source is ready.

Animation tools such as `animate_character` and `animate_object` may expose `confirm_cost`. If the first call requests confirmation or refuses without it, report the cost gate and ask before retrying with confirmation. Do not guess that a failed confirmation gate means the animation endpoint is broken.

## Object Review State

PixelLab object generation can return `review` status when multiple candidate frames are produced. Credits may already be spent, but the object is not finalized.

When an object is in review:

- Report that it needs selection, not that it is stuck.
- For candidate display and user choice parsing, read `reviewable-candidates.md`.
- Use `select_object_frames` or REST `POST /objects/{object_id}/select-frames` only after the user chooses candidates or the request clearly authorized automatic selection.
- Use `dismiss_review` only when the user approves discarding the candidates.

## Expiring And Sensitive Outputs

MCP download URLs may be unauthenticated and should be treated as shareable but sensitive. If a URL is stale, call the matching getter again for a fresh result.

MCP map objects auto-delete after 8 hours. After a successful map-object result, download or persist needed files promptly and warn the user about the expiry.

## REST Error Handling

- `401`/`403`: auth or permission problem. If auth worked earlier in the same session, say it may be expired, rotated, or unavailable to the current process; point back to bearer-token setup and never ask for the token in chat.
- `402`: credits or billing issue. Stop paid work and tell the user PixelLab rejected the operation.
- `400`/`422`: request validation problem. Summarize the field/error, fix the payload, and retry only if the corrected request preserves user intent.
- `409`/`423`: conflict, duplicate, or locked/in-progress state. Inspect the job or asset status before retrying.
- `429`/`529`: rate or overload response. Honor a `Retry-After` header when visible; otherwise wait/back off. Do not immediate-loop or fan out more paid calls.
- Concurrency: an account runs a limited number of jobs in parallel. Dispatch an approved batch up to that limit — full parallelism finishes fastest; back off only on `429`/`529` (honor `Retry-After`). PixelLab grants queue-skipping **priority slots** for sustained high utilization over a rolling 30-minute window, but that is a user-level concern — do not artificially throttle or inflate paid work to farm slots. Limits vary by tier and are not fully published; no public endpoint reports your slot count, utilization, or active-job list — only per-job `GET /background-jobs/{job_id}` and `GET /balance` / MCP `get_balance` (generations/credits). Do not assume a specific number or invent a slots route.

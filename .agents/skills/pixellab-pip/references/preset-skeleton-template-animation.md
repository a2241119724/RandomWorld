# Preset Template And Raw Skeleton Animations

Read this for PixelLab character animation requests that use a preset/template/built-in motion or a custom skeleton. Exact preset ids are cataloged below.

SKILL.md holds the global rules this file does not restate: MCP-first routing with the not-configured / explicit-MCP fallback contract, the south-first direction default and ask-before-all-directions cost gate, frame-order preservation, and the ban on undocumented website / Aseprite-extension endpoints.

Two families: managed preset/template animation on an existing character, and raw skeleton/keypoint animation. Custom skeleton authoring beyond estimated/exported keypoints is future-facing; route keypoint work to the documented REST endpoints below.

PixelLab recommends `animate-with-text-v3` ("Animate with text (new)") over the skeleton-based routes below — both preset/template ids and raw keypoints — because the skeleton model is older and text animation is simpler with better results. Default to v3 text animation (see `animation.md`) — MCP `animate_character(mode="v3", action_description=...)` for a managed character, MCP `animate_image` for a raw frame, REST `animate-with-text-v3` as the fallback; use the skeleton routes when the user explicitly wants a named preset motion or to own/edit keypoints.

## Core Distinction

| User intent | Meaning | Route |
|---|---|---|
| Preset/template/built-in animation | Animate an existing managed character using a named motion template such as `walking-8-frames`, `breathing-idle`, or `jumping-1`. PixelLab generates frames for that character and direction. | Prefer MCP `animate_character`; fallback REST v2 `/characters/animations`. |
| Raw/custom skeleton animation | Generate frames from explicit skeleton keypoints, a reference image, optional masks/init images, and camera settings. | REST v2 `/animate-with-skeleton` and `/estimate-skeleton`. |

## MCP vs REST v2 Field Coverage

MCP `animate_character` covers managed-character template, v3 custom, and pro modes: `mode`, `template_animation_id`, `directions`, `frame_count` (v3 only), `ai_freedom` (template only), `custom_start_frame_base64`/`_url`, `end_frame_base64`/`_url`, `keep_first_frame`, `animation_group_id`, and `confirm_cost` (pro) are all in the current tool schema — re-check the visible schema only when a call rejects a field. It has no raw-skeleton support at all.

It is not field-for-field equivalent to REST `/characters/animations`. REST exposes extra exact-control fields MCP lacks: `description`, `text_guidance_scale`, `outline`, `shading`, `detail`, `isometric`, `color_image`, `force_colors`, `seed`, and inline `enhance_prompt` (v3 mode). Use REST when those fields matter, for integration code, or to validate exact API behavior.

## Managed Preset Animation (MCP)

Flow for an existing or wanted managed character:

1. `get_character(character_id)` to confirm status, template/body type, directions, size, existing animations, and downloadable assets.
2. Choose `template_animation_id` from the character's template family (catalog below).
3. `animate_character` with explicit `directions`.
4. Poll with `get_character` or the returned job IDs, per visible MCP tool behavior.
5. Download frames/ZIP only after completion if local files are needed.

Verify by canonical `template_animation_id`, direction, and frame count, not by a custom display name: MCP smoke (2026-06-30) showed `animation_name` did not override the stored canonical template label returned by `get_character`, and MCP exposed no usage/cost.

```python
animate_character(
    character_id="...",
    template_animation_id="walking-8-frames",
    animation_name="walk",
    directions=["south"],
    mode="template",
)
```

To turn a reference image or GIF frame into a managed character first, use MCP `create_character(mode="v3", description=..., reference_image_url=...)` — v3 is the only mode that accepts a reference sprite, always outputs 8 directions, and prefers the URL form over inline base64 (MCP clients truncate large inline base64) — then animate the returned `character_id` with MCP once the character completes (verified for a horse-headed biped from a source GIF frame). Fall back to REST `create-character-v3` (`description`, `reference_image`, `template_id="mannequin"`, `view`/`no_background`) when MCP is unavailable or `template_id`/`no_background`/`enhance_prompt` matter.

For a newly created quadruped:

```python
create_character(
    description="small black outline companion animal",
    body_type="quadruped",
    template="dog",
    n_directions=4,
    size=92,
)

animate_character(
    character_id="returned-character-id",
    template_animation_id="walk-8-frames",
    directions=["south"],
    mode="template",
)
```

Direction names:

```text
4 directions: south, west, east, north
8 directions: south, south-east, east, north-east, north, north-west, west, south-west
```

Prefer the directions returned by `get_character`; direction order is not semantically meaningful for requests.

## Managed Preset Animation (REST v2)

Use REST when MCP is not visible, exact schema control is needed, or the user asks for API integration.

```text
POST https://api.pixellab.ai/v2/characters/animations
GET  https://api.pixellab.ai/v2/background-jobs/{job_id}
GET  https://api.pixellab.ai/v2/characters/{character_id}
GET  https://api.pixellab.ai/v2/characters/{character_id}/zip
```

MCP `get_character` returns a download link but not the full ZIP bundle — use the REST `/zip` route above when a packaged archive is required.

Request shape:

```json
{
  "character_id": "managed-humanoid-character-id",
  "mode": "template",
  "template_animation_id": "walking-8-frames",
  "animation_name": "walk",
  "directions": ["south"]
}
```

| Field | Guidance |
|---|---|
| `character_id` | Required. Managed character must belong to the authenticated user. |
| `mode` | Use `template` for preset animation ids. Providing `template_animation_id` may auto-detect template mode, but be explicit. |
| `template_animation_id` | Exact preset id. Do not pass display labels. |
| `directions` | Be explicit to avoid accidental all-direction generation. |
| `frame_count` | Only for `mode="v3"` custom text animation. Ignored by preset template mode; do not set it expecting it to override `walking-8-frames`. |
| `custom_start_frame` | Optional v3-only starting pose. Requires exactly one direction, uses the character's stored direction frame when omitted, incompatible with template/pro mode. |
| `end_frame` | Optional v3-only target pose for interpolation. Dimensions must match the start frame, requires exactly one direction, incompatible with template/pro mode. |
| `keep_first_frame` | v3-only, default `true`. Controls whether the reference frame is stored as frame 0 (see Frame Count). Incompatible with template/pro mode. |
| `action_description` | Required for custom v3/pro. Optional in template mode; use only for light customization. |
| `enhance_prompt` | Only for v3 custom mode; do not set it for template/pro. |

Polling:

```text
POST response -> background_job_ids[]
poll each GET /v2/background-jobs/{job_id}
when completed -> use last_response animation metadata or GET character/ZIP
```

## Template Rendering And Tuning

Managed template animation is skeleton-guided re-rendering, not a layer composite of prebuilt arms/legs over the original frame. The template supplies motion/pose guidance while PixelLab re-renders frames for the character and direction. It can preserve the character and move limbs correctly yet still introduce artifacts such as heavier leg shadows, palette drift, or rigid/robotic motion.

Public controls when a preset walk/idle/jump is close but needs style correction:

| Control | Use |
|---|---|
| `action_description` | Lightly bias the template, e.g. "relaxed natural walk with slight shoulder sway" or "keep flat shading, avoid heavy leg shadows". |
| `text_guidance_scale` | How strongly template mode follows `action_description`; try moderate values first, very high can distort identity. |
| `shading` | Main knob for heavy shadow artifacts. Try `flat shading`, `minimal shading`, or the character's original shading. |
| `detail` | Lower detail can reduce noisy limb pixels or over-rendered joints. |
| `outline` | Reassert the original outline when limbs become too thick, broken, or overdrawn. |
| `color_image` + `force_colors` | Constrain palette when template frames introduce extra dark tones. |

Template mode does not expose direct controls for 3D depth maps, per-bone easing, stride curves, secondary motion, limb IK, `bone_scaling`, shadow strength, or keypoint edits, and `frame_count` does not tune preset motion; choose a different template id such as `walking-4-frames`/`walking-6-frames`/`walking-8-frames`. If the rendering style is the problem, retry template mode with conservative style controls. If the gait itself is too rigid or robotic, MCP `animate_character` exposes `ai_freedom` (0–900, default 0 = rigid template following; higher lets the pose deviate more from the template skeleton) — raise it before escalating. Only if the motion is still wrong (missing weight shift, bad limb timing), use v3/pro custom animation or raw skeleton/Aseprite keypoint authoring instead of expecting preset mode to behave like a full rig editor.

For template mode keep `action_description` light or omit it; the template id carries the motion. Use `animation_name` for organization. Do not use prompt enhancement for template mode.

```json
{
  "template_animation_id": "walking-8-frames",
  "animation_name": "walk",
  "directions": ["south"]
}
```

Only add `action_description` for a variant the route supports:

```json
{
  "template_animation_id": "walking-8-frames",
  "action_description": "a steady cheerful walk with a slight head bob",
  "text_guidance_scale": 6,
  "shading": "flat shading",
  "detail": "low detail",
  "outline": "single color black outline"
}
```

## Raw Skeleton Keypoint Routes

Use these only for explicit custom skeleton/keypoint workflows, not ordinary built-in walk/idle requests.

```text
POST /v2/estimate-skeleton
POST /v2/animate-with-skeleton
```

`estimate-skeleton` takes a character image and returns keypoints. `animate-with-skeleton` accepts fields such as:

```text
image_size
reference_image
skeleton_keypoints  (exactly 3 frames)
view
direction
guidance_scale
init_images
inpainting_images
mask_images
color_image
seed
```

MCP `create_character` / `animate_character` are managed-character tools: they use template animations and stored skeleton metadata internally but do not accept arbitrary keypoint arrays. Use REST for raw skeleton estimation/animation unless the visible MCP schema explicitly exposes `estimate_skeleton`, `animate_with_skeleton`, `skeleton_keypoints`, or equivalent keypoint fields.

## Auto-Rig Skeleton Pipeline

Use this route for "auto rig", "estimate skeleton", "rig this sprite", "export skeleton for API", "animate with this skeleton", "my keypoints", "pose JSON", or a skeleton pipeline from a simple humanoid prompt. It is REST-first:

```text
source image or generated reference frame
  -> REST estimate-skeleton
  -> save/export keypoint JSON
  -> optional local/Aseprite keypoint editing
  -> REST animate-with-skeleton or create-image-bitforge
```

Raw skeleton animation is the right route when the user wants to own, export, edit, or reuse the keypoints; managed template animation is still right for built-in managed motions.

| User starts with | Best route |
|---|---|
| Existing sprite/image | Use it as the `estimate-skeleton` input and as `reference_image` for later `animate-with-skeleton` unless the user supplies a separate reference. |
| Aseprite-authored skeleton | Export from Aseprite, convert `pose_keypoints` to REST `skeleton_keypoints`, then call REST. |
| Prompt only ("humanoid knight") | Create or ask for a base reference frame first; prefer a PixelLab-generated humanoid/mannequin frame, then estimate keypoints from it. |
| Existing managed character id | Preset motions: MCP/REST managed template animation. Raw skeleton ownership: fetch a direction frame, estimate/export keypoints, then REST raw skeleton routes. |

For simple humanoid prompts default the body plan to humanoid/mannequin (MCP `create_character(body_type="humanoid")` or REST `create-character-v3` with `template_id="mannequin"`).

Programmatic steps:

1. Estimate or author keypoints. REST `POST /v2/estimate-skeleton` for a sprite/image; Aseprite "Export skeleton for API" writes normalized `pose_keypoints`. Local tooling may edit/validate JSON keypoints client-side (not a PixelLab API call).
2. Convert exported keypoints to the target REST field: Aseprite `{ "pose_keypoints": [[...], ...] }` -> REST animation `skeleton_keypoints: [[...], ...]`; REST single-image BitForge `skeleton_keypoints: [...]`.
3. Call `POST /v2/animate-with-skeleton` with `image_size`, `reference_image`, `skeleton_keypoints`, and explicit `view`/`direction`.
4. Add `init_images`, `inpainting_images`, `mask_images`, or `color_image` when the user supplied those roles or the route requires them.

`estimate-skeleton` returns a skeleton for one pose; it does not invent a walk/run sequence. `animate-with-skeleton` requires exactly 3 keypoint frames (any other count returns 422), so with only one estimated pose either ask for/create the two missing poses, author a sequence in Aseprite, use managed template animation (built-in walk/idle/jump), or use v3 custom text animation (motion without skeleton ownership) — MCP `animate_character(mode="v3")`/`animate_image`, REST `animate-with-text-v3` as fallback.

### View/Direction Trap And Defaults

- For a typical RPG/down-facing sprite, set `view="low top-down"` and `direction="south"` explicitly.
- For side-view/platformer sprites, set `view="side"` and `direction="east"` or `west`.
- Do not rely on `animate-with-skeleton` defaults: current OpenAPI defaults are `view="side"` and `direction="east"`, which are wrong for many RPG sprites. Do not infer defaults from website managed-character examples, which may use low top-down/south.
- Interpret human/person/player/NPC/robot/humanoid-monster and upright two-legged animals as humanoid/mannequin.
- Save a sidecar manifest with `body_plan`, `source_image`, `image_size`, `view`, `direction`, `estimated_keypoints`, and the payload-ready `skeleton_keypoints`.

Current schema requires `image_size` and `reference_image`; custom keypoint workflows also need explicit `skeleton_keypoints` or a prior `estimate-skeleton`. Endpoint prose lists common sizes `16`, `32`, `64`, `128`, `256` while schema may allow other 16-256 dimensions; refresh OpenAPI before exact production code for nonstandard sizes, and ask for missing image/keypoint roles before spending credits.

## Aseprite Boundary

Estimate skeleton maps to REST `POST /v2/estimate-skeleton`; authoring/animating from keypoints maps to REST `POST /v2/animate-with-skeleton`; pose-guided image generation maps to REST `create-image-bitforge` (`skeleton_keypoints`/`skeleton_guidance_scale`). Aseprite exports normalized `pose_keypoints`; convert to REST `skeleton_keypoints`. Everything else in the Aseprite extension (edit skeleton, re-pose, insert template skeleton, its private template-animation flow and local skeleton JSON) is editor-internal and out of scope for public automation per SKILL.md. Aseprite's local template catalog is older/smaller than the managed preset IDs below; do not assume every managed id such as `breathing-idle` or `jumping-1` exists there.

## Preset Template Families

Known managed template families, last verified against MCP docs, REST OpenAPI, and the website Add Animation bundle on 2026-06-30: `mannequin`, `dog`, `cat`, `horse`, `bear`, `lion`.

Use the right vocabulary for the surface:

| Surface | Field | Valid values | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCP `create_character` | `body_type` | `humanoid`, `quadruped` | Use `humanoid` for bipedal/mannequin body plans. Use `quadruped` only for four-legged animals. |
| MCP `create_character` | `template` | `bear`, `cat`, `dog`, `horse`, `lion` | Required only when `body_type="quadruped"`. Ignored for humanoid characters. |
| MCP `create_character` | `proportions` | preset `default`, `chibi`, `cartoon`, `stylized`, `realistic_male`, `realistic_female`, `heroic`, or custom scale JSON | Humanoid only. This is how MCP expresses realistic/chibi humanoid proportions; it is not a separate `body_type`. |
| REST managed character create | `template_id` | `mannequin`, `bear`, `cat`, `dog`, `horse`, `lion` | `mannequin` is the bipedal/humanoid skeleton reconstruction template and the default in current OpenAPI. |
| REST managed animation | `template_animation_id` | Exact animation ids from the character's family | Does not take `body_type`; the managed character already carries the body plan/template family. |
| Website Add Animation | `Template` | `mannequin`, `dog`, `cat`, `horse`, `bear`, `lion` | UI label for the managed character's animation family. |

Choose the template family by body plan and stance, not species. Map human/person/player/NPC/wizard/knight/robot/biped requests, and upright/two-footed animals (horse person, cat warrior, fox mage), to humanoid/mannequin unless managed metadata proves quadruped. Four-legged dog/cat/horse/bear/lion map to `quadruped` plus the matching `template`; a four-legged animal outside these five uses the closest template or ask. Treat "mannequin" and misspellings like "manniquin" as the humanoid plan. Gotcha: do not pass `template="mannequin"` to MCP `create_character` (`template` is quadruped-only there); REST uses `template_id="mannequin"`. If a character already exists, prefer its stored `template_id` from `get_character` / REST `GET /characters/{character_id}` over guessing from the prompt.

## Preset Animation IDs

Use exact ids. Do not send labels such as "Walk (8 frames)". This catalog was last verified against the website Add Animation bundle on 2026-06-30. Official REST docs expose the `template_animation_id` field but no stable public enum endpoint; refresh visible MCP tool docs or official docs before claiming "all available animations" or building long-lived integrations.

Ordered by likely request frequency, mannequin/humanoid first because most player, NPC, human, and biped requests map there.

Common label mappings and exact-id passthroughs:

| User says | Use id |
|---|---|
| "human walk 8 frames" | `walking-8-frames` |
| "person idle" | `breathing-idle` |
| "wizard jump" | `jumping-1` or `jumping-2` |
| "bark" | `bark` |
| "dog walk 8 frames" | `walk-8-frames` |
| "dog fast walk" | `fast-walk` |
| "humanoid walk 8 frames" | `walking-8-frames` |
| "fight idle" | `fight-stance-idle-8-frames` |

If an animation exists for one template family but not another, say so and offer the closest same-family option. Do not silently substitute `walking-8-frames` for a quadruped `walk-8-frames` or vice versa.

## Frame Count

- Preset template mode owns its frame count through the selected template id; do not set `frame_count` expecting it to override `walking-8-frames`.
- V3 custom mode owns frame count through `frame_count` 4-16, even only, default 8. V3 also stores the reference frame as frame 0 (so `frame_count=8` stores 9 frames) unless `keep_first_frame=false`; details in `animation.md`.
- Report the actual returned frame count if it differs from the id or expectation.

## Verification

Before reporting success, confirm: the requested `template_animation_id` was used; the requested vs actually completed direction set; the returned frame count; dimensions match the character. If exporting through Aseprite, verify tag/frame count/order and that the original frames were not rewritten.

Refresh official docs/OpenAPI/MCP docs before exact code claims when a template id is not here, the visible MCP schema differs, the user asks for all current animations, pricing/frame limits matter, or custom skeleton/keypoint support is requested.

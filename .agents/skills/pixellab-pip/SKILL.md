# PixelLab Pip

Classify the request, choose the supported PixelLab surface, then act. Answer questions directly when the request is a question.

## Workflow

1. Classify intent; values combine, such as `animate + cost_sensitive`:
   `question | setup | update | uninstall | bark | auto | create asset | edit/transform | animate | prompt_enhancement | cost_sensitive | integrate/code | check balance/status | troubleshoot docs/API | website/editor assistance | aseprite_integration | blueprint/recipe`.
   A standalone `setup`, `update`, `uninstall`, `bark`, or `auto` word after an explicit skill invocation, such as `/pixellab-pip setup` or `@pixellab-pip bark off`, is that intent: for setup read `references/setup.md`, for update read `references/update.md`, for uninstall read `references/uninstall.md`, for bark read `references/bark.md`, for auto read `references/auto.md`.
2. Classify the target:
   `general_image | skill_icon | item_icon | background | character | portrait_character | font | object | effect_vfx | ui | whole_map | map_image | map_object | top_down_tileset | sidescroller_tileset | multi_shape_tileset | path_tiles | building_kit | isometric_tile | tile_variants | animation | existing_image`.
   Fitted visual additions to an existing character image, such as hair, facial features, wearables, accessories, or held gear, are `existing_image` paperdoll edits, not standalone `object` requests, unless the user explicitly wants a separate unattached prop.
3. Choose the surface with Surface Rules, then the route with the Intent Router. When the user explicitly asks for Aseprite handling, read `references/aseprite-cli.md`; PixelLab MCP/REST generates, documented Aseprite CLI/Lua handles local workspace, import/export, packaging, and launch only.
4. Use MCP only if PixelLab MCP tools are visible as callable tools, bare or prefixed such as `mcp__pixellab__create_character` (match by suffix). If the user explicitly asked for MCP, do not silently fall back; report that MCP is unavailable and offer setup or an approved REST v2 fallback. Otherwise, when MCP is unavailable, use the matching documented REST v2 endpoint. If both are unavailable or fail, explain why before any non-PixelLab fallback.
5. Before repeated paid prompt-only retries, inspect the chosen tool or endpoint schema for generation controls such as guidance, adherence/strength, reference images, palette images, or style options, and use the ones that target the failure mode. Before the first paid call to any endpoint that consumes a supplied input image, inspect its schema and embed the source image in the correct field — never send such a request without its input image. Refresh official docs only when a needed tool, endpoint, field, auth, SDK, pricing, or model/mode fact is missing or unclear (see Current Docs Refresh).
6. For consistency-sensitive work, summarize the user's identity, style, palette, view, and reference anchors. Ask up to three blocking questions before a credit-spending call.
7. Prepare natural-language parameters per Text Preparation. For non-English or mixed-language requests, read `references/localization.md`.
8. For animation, preserve the user's requested frame count; otherwise use the endpoint or template default. Exception: preset/template character animations take no `frame_count`; pick a matching template id such as `walking-8-frames` (catalog in `references/preset-skeleton-template-animation.md`) or fall back to v3 custom mode. Preserve PixelLab's returned frame order; no ping-pong, reversed, duplicated, or trimmed outputs unless the user asks for that playback style.
9. If the user says cheap, budget, low-cost, fewer credits, or similar, read `references/cost-routing.md` before choosing a paid route, and ask before each extra paid attempt unless a concrete budget or attempt count was approved.
10. Before live generation, confirm the PixelLab bearer token is configured without asking the user to paste it into chat (see Auth And Execution).
11. `seed`: omit by default; PixelLab randomizes it. Send it in two cases only — the user gave a seed (send verbatim), or two or more calls share near-identical wording and must land on the same composition (seed-lock): generate one random positive integer (`0` means random, so never 0) and send that same value on every call in the set. Never ask the user for a seed.
12. Act or answer. Once the job's live generation(s) have returned image(s) — after the last one in a chain — do three follow-ups before the final report, even if the user did not ask: the completion sound (`references/bark.md`), the manifest (`references/usage-reporting.md`), and the `*.blueprint.json` (`references/blueprint.md`). Then send one final report. Ask a short clarification only for known collisions. Before that report, send only a blocker or a question you need answered — never progress, status, findings, or intentions; those belong in the final report. For a pending job, keep polling its getter in-turn until its status is `completed` or `failed` — a still-running job is never a reason to end the turn (`references/job-lifecycle.md`). If the turn is being cut off before it finishes, continue with a bounded background wait instead of stopping. Hand the job back to the user only when you can do neither — no way to keep polling and no way to background a wait — then report the job or asset ID and the getter that resumes the check, and say credits were spent. Exception — chunk reveal: when an approved run produces several separately-completing image jobs (a multi-shot cinematic chain, an all-directions animation, an approved multi-asset batch), post each job's saved output — path and inline preview link — as that job completes, and fold the last job into the final report rather than revealing it twice. This covers distinct sequential jobs only, not the multiple images a single job returns at once (8-direction character, animation frames, rotations, tileset tiles, review candidates), which go straight to the final report.

## Asset Integrity

- Every pixel of requested art must originate from PixelLab or the user. Local tools may read, download, assemble, package, import/export, preview, verify, mask, pad, crop, resize, and format-convert those pixels. Locally authored generation controls such as masks, palette swatches/`color_image`, reference guides, and shape templates are allowed as inputs; report them as inputs. Do not draw, repaint, or synthesize requested content locally unless the user explicitly approves a labeled non-PixelLab fallback.
- Reviewable static candidates: when a static image-style MCP tool or REST endpoint returns multiple alternatives, read `references/reviewable-candidates.md` before selecting, saving, or continuing from one.
- Do not bake a colored, checkerboard, white, black, green-screen, or matte background into transparent frames, final GIFs, spritesheets, previews, or report images unless the user explicitly asks for it. A checkerboard is allowed only as a clearly labeled inspection aid kept separate from final deliverables.
- Do not post-process PixelLab output into a claimed final asset without explicit approval. Local crop/split/format work that preserves original pixels is allowed when reported honestly; resizing, reassembling, compositing, or repairing failed outputs locally must not be called final without approval. Exception: when a request used `no_background: true` but the output kept a background, read `references/background-removal.md` and attempt safe removal when verification shows the background is removable without changing the art.
- Save downloaded generations, derived previews, manifests, and packages in a named per-generation subfolder under the `pixellab-pip-generations/` folder at the user's project/workspace root — not loose in its root, and never resolved against a background or detached process's working directory, which may default to the home folder — unless the user names another location. A returned base64 image may be raw RGBA rather than PNG; confirm a saved image decodes to a valid PNG, and when a response exposes more than one image field, save the PNG-encoded one. Produce only the requested output formats or the route's minimal standard artifacts. When a job returns multiple separate images, always compile one standard preview alongside the individual files: a spritesheet for a collection of distinct sprites, or a looping preview GIF when the images are frames of a single animation (read `references/local-asset-assembly.md` for spritesheet grids and GIF settings). No APNG or extra preview/viewer formats unless asked.
- After a generation returns image(s), write a `<name>.blueprint.json` beside the outputs per `references/blueprint.md` — canonical portable `_pixellab` connection metadata, the exact route bodies, structured `TASK` steps for material work performed outside PixelLab calls, and a `_comment_prompt` holding the user's original prompt as they intended it. Remove host-added wrappers such as connector Markdown, app URIs, hidden local paths, or tool-call serialization; keep the visible command text, such as `/pixellab-pip`. When the generation used one or more user-supplied input images (any role — source, reference, style, mask, init, frame, and the like), copy each into the folder by copying the file, not by reading and re-writing it.
- After every live generation flow, write a manifest beside the outputs using `references/usage-reporting.md`; keep its private audit/resume data out of the shareable blueprint.

## Destructive Remote Actions

Deleting, clearing, or overwriting existing remote PixelLab assets — characters, objects, tiles, tilesets, fonts, UI, portraits, their states, animations, or tags — in a way that discards or replaces content already stored remotely is irreversible and requires explicit user permission before it happens: either an instruction that names the deletion or overwrite, or the user's approval of a destructive change you propose. Creating a new asset, state, or animation is additive, not destructive, and is not gated here. Never delete or overwrite unilaterally as an inferred fix, cleanup, reset, sync, migration, or troubleshooting step, and never because a local list, cache, or app view looks empty, stale, or out of sync — the remote is the source of truth, so investigate read-only first (`list_*`/`get_*`, REST `GET`) and report what you find instead of destroying it. Proposing a destructive change is fine; carrying it out before the user approves is not. Before a confirmed destructive op, list exactly what will be removed or replaced (names/IDs and count); bulk or clear-all requires the user to confirm that scope. This covers the `delete_*` MCP tools and REST delete/replace endpoints.

For character file synchronization, compare the returned `updated_at` value or URL `?t=` stamp with the local copy and download only changed assets; do not use a stale cached image as evidence that the remote needs replacement.

## Surface Rules

| Surface | Use for | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Hosted MCP | Managed PixelLab assets with IDs, polling, downloads, list/get/delete helpers, talking-portrait/lip-sync tools, and project/sandbox/agent helpers, including `create_ui_asset`, `create_font`, or `create_portrait_character` when visible; also raw-image primitives `create_image_pixflux`/`create_image_pixen`/`create_image_pro`/`get_image`, `edit_image`, `inpaint_image`, `animate_image` when visible — these need no managed asset. | REST-only controls such as UI-asset `style_image`/`project_id`, multi-image style reference (`generate-with-style-v2`), or stateless lip sync; convert-to-pixel-art, resize, remove-background (no MCP tool); or any MCP call when PixelLab MCP tools are not visible. |
| REST v2 | Scripts, batch jobs, server integrations, exact endpoint control, and REST-only capabilities such as multi-image style reference, freeform UI, base-tier edit/inpaint controls, skeleton animation, and prompt enhancement (see the Intent Router for exact routes) — plus any of the MCP-covered work below when MCP tools are not visible. | Guessing SDK methods without checking the installed SDK or current docs. |
| Website / Map Workshop | Human product surface, full-map manual work, rich libraries, visible browser assistance. | Programmatic use of copied browser session tokens or undocumented internal endpoints used by first-party surfaces. |
| Aseprite plugin | In-editor workflows when the user is actively working inside Aseprite. | Treating private first-party extension endpoints as public REST/MCP contracts. |
| Aseprite CLI | Explicit Aseprite handling after PixelLab produced files: `.aseprite` workspaces, importing frames as layers/frames/tags, palette work, export/open via documented CLI/Lua. | Mouse/OCR UI automation or hidden control of the PixelLab Aseprite extension. |
| Pixelorama / website editor | The PixelLab website editor is Pixelorama-powered; assist it only as visible browser automation after explicit permission, and ask again before login/session actions, spending credits, generations, downloads, edits, or deletes. | Hidden automation, undocumented endpoint calls, or any destructive action without a second confirmation. |
| REST v1 | Existing legacy code and old SDK compatibility. | New work unless the user explicitly needs v1. |

Hosted MCP tool names are not REST endpoints; do not curl MCP tool names as `/v2/...` paths.

## Intent Router

For any atlas or spritesheet request with known or requested cell dimensions, also read `references/local-asset-assembly.md` for the required grid inspection preview.

| User intent | Default route | REST v2 route for code/exact control |
|---|---|---|
| Character, player, NPC, enemy, creature | MCP `create_character` with `mode="v3"` by default, then `create_character_state`, `animate_character`, `get_character`, `update_character_tags`, list/delete helpers. A character group's `name` is shared; when the user names a new state, pass `state_name`, otherwise PixelLab derives it from the edit description. For a follow-up animation on a multi-direction character, animate `south` first; ask before animating all directions. `outline` and outline wording in `description` are both ignored on v3 and Pro character generation; say so instead of spending credits tuning it. Neither the schema nor an echoed `get_character` value is evidence otherwise — only changed art is. Pixen/v3/new may underweight user instructions for shape, pose, or view; Character Pro follows the user's description more closely when higher cost and a different style are acceptable. `get_character` returns a download link, not a full ZIP bundle — use REST `GET /characters/{id}/zip` when the user needs the packaged archive. | `create-character-v3`, `create-character-with-4-directions`, `create-character-with-8-directions`, `create-character-pro`, state/animation/tags/ZIP/list/get/delete endpoints. |
| Portrait-to-character or character-to-portrait | MCP `create_portrait_character` + `get_portrait_character` when visible. | `portrait-character-pro` (Pro image conversion). Supplied-image roles: `references/image-input-roles.md`. |
| Talking portrait, mouth/viseme sprites, talking GIF, or lip-sync timing plan | Read `references/vocal-animation.md`. Use the MCP `set_character_portrait`, `create_vocal_animation` + `get_vocal_animation`, `create_talking_gif`, and `get_lip_sync` tools when visible. | `POST /characters/{character_id}/portrait`, `POST` + dedicated `GET /vocal-animation/{job_id}`, `POST /talking-gif`, and `POST /lip-sync`; REST is required for stateless lip sync. |
| Pixel/bitmap font, font atlas | MCP `create_font` + `get_font` when visible. | `generate-font-pro` (Pro). |
| Skill/ability/spell/action-bar/hotbar icon, inventory item/equipment/loot/pickup icon, emoji, or icon sheet | Read `references/icon.md` before choosing an endpoint or generating. | The reference covers route choice, background defaults, sheet sizing, prompt wording, and verification. |
| Standalone object, prop, pickup, weapon, furniture (not an icon) | MCP `create_1_direction_object`, `create_8_direction_object`, object state/animation/tags/review tools. An object group's `name` is shared; when the user names a new state, pass `state_name`, otherwise PixelLab derives it from the edit description. Object creation is Pro Tools (20-40 generations). | `create-1-direction-object`, `create-8-direction-object`, object state/animation/tags/list/get/delete endpoints. |
| Tileset or terrain transition with no stated type or projection; square top-down, Wang, or autotile tileset | Read `references/tileset.md`, then MCP `create_topdown_tileset`; this is the default when no tileset type, projection, or route is specified. | `create-tileset`, `tilesets`. |
| Explicit hex, isometric, or oblique connectable terrain transition; or explicit `create_tiles_pro`/`create-tiles-pro` tileset mode | Read `references/tileset.md`, then MCP `create_tiles_pro` with `tile_feature="tileset"`. | `create-tiles-pro` with `tile_feature: "tileset"`, then `tiles-pro/{tile_id}`. |
| Sidescroller/platformer tileset | Read `references/tileset.md`, then MCP `create_sidescroller_tileset`. | `create-tileset-sidescroller`. |
| Isometric tile/block/floor | MCP `create_isometric_tile`; map thickness wording to `tile_shape` (`thin tile`, `thick tile`, `block` — same values as REST, default `block`). | `create-isometric-tile` with `isometric_tile_shape` (`thin tile`, `thick tile`, `block`). |
| Multiple independent tile variants (hex, octagon, square, or isometric) | MCP `create_tiles_pro` with no `tile_feature`. | `create-tiles-pro`, `tiles-pro/{tile_id}`. |
| Connectable path/road tile set | MCP `create_path_tiles`; shares `get_tiles_pro`/`list_tiles_pro`/`delete_tiles_pro` with `create_tiles_pro` — no dedicated getter. | `create-tiles-pro` with `tile_feature: "roads"`. |
| Building kit (floor, connectable walls, doorways, pillar, stairs) | Read `references/tileset.md`, then MCP `create_building_kit`; shares `get_tiles_pro`/`list_tiles_pro`/`delete_tiles_pro` with `create_tiles_pro` — no dedicated getter. | `create-tiles-pro` with `tile_feature: "building"` and `building_*` fields. |
| Hard-projection top-down/south-facing building sprite | Read `references/style-reference.md`; use MCP `create_image_pro` or REST `generate-with-style-v2`; apply the reference's verification. | Do not route a single sprite to `create_building_kit`. |
| General image, sprite, standalone asset that is not an icon or emoji | MCP `create_image_pixflux`/`create_image_pixen`/`create_image_pro` + `get_image` when MCP-first — same model choice as REST, minus multi-image style reference (REST-only). For explicit Create Image Pro, `create_image_pro`/`generate-image-v2`, exact grids/sheets, or below-32px cells, read `references/create-image-pro.md` first. For full-body Pixen characters, read `references/pixen-character-prompt.md`. Model character: PixFlux = lower detail, loose/painterly (frames whole subjects); Pixen = high detail, tight framing; Pixen and Pro crop larger subjects; Pro for style/variety or closer adherence to the user's description. Pixen/v3/new has isometric bias and may underweight user instructions such as `view`/`direction`; prefer Pro for static south-facing when higher cost and different character style is acceptable. | `create-image-pixen`, `generate-image-v2`, `create-image-pixflux`, `generate-with-style-v2`. |
| Background, scene, backdrop | MCP `create_image_pixflux`/`create_image_pixen` (`no_background: false`) when MCP-first, else REST v2. Route by whether a subject is present: subject-less backdrop (empty landscape/sky/room, no figure) → PixFlux; full scene with a subject in an environment → Pixen. Do not use Pro `generate-image-v2`/`create_image_pro` here — not worth its ~12× cost for backdrops or scenes. | `create-image-pixflux-background` (same schema as `create-image-pixflux`, so `create_image_pixflux` covers it too); verify current size/field support before exact code. |
| UI, HUD, button, panel, health bar, menu | MCP `create_ui_asset` + `get_ui_asset` when MCP-first — it has both `pieces` (rounded_rect/circle/polygon) and `elements` (button, icon_button, toolbar, tab, panel, window, health_bar, avatar, triangle/pentagon/hexagon/octagon); mind its aspect-gated size caps (square ≤512×512, 16:9 ≤688×384, 9:16 ≤384×688, 4:3 ≤600×448, 3:4 ≤448×600). REST v2 `create-ui-asset` (Pro) only when `style_image` or `project_id` is needed, or MCP is unavailable. `generate-ui-v2` (REST-only, no MCP tool) for loose/raw UI images, especially with a `concept_image`. | Do not route shape-piece/layout requests to `generate-ui-v2`. |
| Image edit, inpaint, mask, convert, resize, remove background | For supplied images read `references/image-input-roles.md`. MCP `edit_image` and `inpaint_image` are Pro routes; prefer their URL inputs and use inline base64 only when needed. Use REST for cheaper base edit/inpaint or extra weak-guidance controls. Convert/resize/remove-background have no MCP tool; use REST v2. | `inpaint`, `inpaint-v3` (Pro), `edit-image`, `edit-images-v2`, `image-to-pixelart`, `image-to-pixelart-pro`, `resize`, `remove-background`. |
| Fitted paperdoll addition on an existing character image | Treat as an `existing_image` edit anchored on the base frame; read `references/paperdolling.md` before choosing layer/composite outputs. | Do not use object generation for fitted layers unless the user explicitly wants an unattached prop. |
| Style-reference or consistent-style generation | Read `references/style-reference.md`. Single style image or labelled references → MCP `create_image_pro` (preferred image URLs, plus `style_copy`) when MCP-first, else REST `generate-image-v2`. Multi-image style reference (`style_images` array, with optional `style_description`) is REST-only — no MCP tool has that shape. | `generate-with-style-v2` or `generate-image-v2` style/reference fields after checking current docs. |
| Editor-only utilities (Canny/Pose/Depth, reduce colors, unzoom, pixel correction, reshape) | Read `references/editor-only-utilities.md`. For file-level palette quantization/reduction/replacement, read `references/aseprite-cli.md` even without explicit Aseprite wording. | No public REST/MCP route exists for these; do not invent `/v2/...` routes. |
| Try on garment/accessory | Website Try on (single composited image); REST `transfer-outfit-v2` only for animation-frame outfit transfer. | Try on does not return isolated paperdoll layers. |
| Multi-image combine/edit | MCP `edit_image` (Pro; preferred `image_urls`, or inline base64, with optional reference URL/base64) when MCP-first, else REST v2 `edit-images-v2`; website/editor for visual experimental flows. | Aseprite's `generate-multi-edit` is an internal endpoint, not public REST. |
| Prompt enhancement | Matching enhance endpoint or inline `enhance_prompt` per Text Preparation. | `enhance-pixen-prompt`, `enhance-character-v3-prompt`, `enhance-animation-v3-prompt`. |
| Preset/template/built-in animation, named motion, or custom skeleton/keypoints | Read `references/preset-skeleton-template-animation.md`; it splits MCP managed-template vs REST raw-skeleton routes. | Do not call website root `/generate-animation/background` or Aseprite extension internals. |
| Auto-rig, estimate skeleton, animate from keypoints | Read `references/preset-skeleton-template-animation.md`. | `estimate-skeleton`, then `animate-with-skeleton`. |
| Raw non-skeleton animation, interpolation, outfit transfer, rotate | MCP `animate_image` animates any supplied image directly — preferred frame URLs or inline base64 plus `action`, with an optional last frame for a tween — no managed character/object needed. For 8-rotations-from-an-image, MCP only partially covers it by regenerating rather than rotating the exact input: `create_character(mode="v3", reference_image_base64=…)` for character/humanoid sprites, `create_8_direction_object(reference_image_base64=…)` for props. Otherwise REST v2. Read `references/animation.md` for frame anchors, idle-loop risk, and verification. | `animate-with-text-v3`, `edit-animation-v2`, `interpolation-v2`, `transfer-outfit-v2`, `rotate`, `generate-8-rotations-v2/v3` (use this when the exact input pixels must be preserved, not regenerated). No public 4-rotation route. For a start→end tween prefer `animate-with-text-v3`; use `interpolation-v2` only on an explicit Pro/v2 request. |
| Multi-shot, multi-second, or seamless-loop cinematic (a scene longer than one clip) | Read `references/cinematic.md`; requires a user-specified budget, a documented plan, and per-shot validation. MCP `animate_image` with preferred frame URLs or inline base64 when MCP-first, else REST. | `animate-with-text-v3` — one looped clip for cyclic motion, chained shots (each from the previous handoff frame) for evolving scenes, or `first_frame`+`last_frame` for a strict start→end tween. |
| Map image / visual level concept | MCP `create_image_pixflux`/`create_image_pixen` + `get_image` when MCP-first (same subject-vs-subject-less split as the Background row), else REST v2 image/background route; website or Aseprite for map extension workflows. | No public map CRUD/extension/texture surface is documented. |
| Map object | MCP `create_map_object` + `get_map_object`; download promptly — MCP map objects auto-delete after 8 hours. | `POST /map-objects`, then `GET /map-objects/{object_id}` for status + metadata. |
| Whole map, Map Workshop, map CRUD/export | Website manually, or generate components via MCP/REST. | No public map CRUD surface is documented. |
| Static effect/VFX sprite | If a target image is supplied and the user asks to add an effect to it, MCP `edit_image` (pro) when MCP-first, else REST image edit, on that target; otherwise default isolated reusable VFX to Create Image Pro (`create_image_pro`/`generate-image-v2`) and read `references/create-image-pro.md`. | Pro is the reliable effects/variety route found in focused testing; Pixen is retry-heavy and unreliable for effect-only assets. Edit routes return a whole edited image, not an isolated effect layer; no standalone VFX endpoint exists. |
| Animated effect/VFX | MCP `animate_image` for a raw (non-managed) image, REST v2 raw animation, or MCP object animation for a managed object. | `animate-with-text-v3`, `animate-with-skeleton`, or object animation endpoints; VFX is a description, not an endpoint. |
| Balance, credits, account check | MCP `get_balance` if available. | `GET /balance`. |
| REST async job status | Usually `GET /background-jobs/{job_id}`; vocal animation is the exception and uses `GET /vocal-animation/{job_id}`. | MCP managed assets use resource-specific `get_*` tools instead. |
| PixelLab projects, sandbox, chat, deployed agents, MCP help/feedback | Read `references/mcp-platform-tools.md` before using `list_projects`, `sandbox_*`, `chat_*`, or `agent_*` tools. | No public REST v2 equivalent is documented. |
| Discover, inspect, select, or replay blueprints/recipes, including a supplied `*.blueprint.json` | Read `references/blueprint.md` and follow its discovery, selection, and replay contract. A blueprint name that contains an asset word (e.g. "knight") is still blueprint intent when the conversation identifies it as one. | The exact route recorded in the blueprint (`MCP <tool>` or `POST /v2/...`). |

## Clarify Only For Collisions

- "Presets": infer bundled blueprints from established blueprint context and preset/template
  animations from animation or motion context; ask which collection only when neither is clear.
- "Tiles": top-down/autotile tileset, platformer tileset, explicit-projection connectable set, independent variants, one isometric tile, path set, building kit, or packed texture sheet?
- "Map": whole map, map object, map image, tileset, isometric tile, or tile variants?
- "Isometric tileset": one tile, independent variants, or a connectable terrain set? Ask when unclear; only the connectable set uses `tile_feature="tileset"`.
- "Object/character": infer character for people, NPCs, creatures, or identity/state animation; object for standalone props, pickups, furniture, weapons. Ask only if unclear.
- Animation direction on a multi-direction character: default to `south` for one preview candidate; ask only when `south` is unavailable, directions are unknown, or the user needs another gameplay-facing direction. Animate all directions only on explicit request or approval.
- "Effect": static or animated? If a target image is supplied, infer a one-off edit; ask reusable-asset vs one-off only without a clear edit target.
- "Paperdoll": gather base image, desired layers, target regions, directions, and whether the user wants separate transparent layer files, editor layers, composited previews, or both; see `references/paperdolling.md`.
- Supplied images: infer each file's low-risk endpoint-specific role from wording. Before credit-spending calls, ask when role uncertainty (identity vs style vs concept vs edit target vs mask vs palette vs first/last frame) would change the endpoint or output; see `references/image-input-roles.md`.
- If prompt enhancement adds material inferred details, surface the proposed description in the cost-approval gate (`references/auto.md`) before a credit-spending call.

## References

Resolve every `references/` path against this skill's own directory (the parent of this `SKILL.md`) and use an absolute path in the tool call. If that directory is unknown to you, find the `pixellab-pip/references/` folder by listing or searching the workspace and agent-skill directories before acting; do not skip the read. When a rule names a reference, open and read it before acting, then follow its current text — not memory or a summary. Your training does not contain these PixelLab-specific contracts, so answering from general knowledge — for example treating Pip as a `pip`-installed Python package — will be wrong. If a required reference cannot be read, say so and stop rather than improvise its contract.

Read each reference only when its trigger applies:

- Bearer-token setup, PixelLab UI naming, MCP auth reuse: `references/credentials.md`.
- Setup wizard for MCP, REST v2 fallback, auth after install: `references/setup.md`.
- Update an installed Pip to the latest version: `references/update.md`.
- Remove an installed Pip: `references/uninstall.md`.

## Model And Mode Terms

Treat PixelLab model/provider language as product labels unless official docs disclose more. Do not invent provider internals where docs are silent.

- `Pixen`, `PixFlux`: product/workflow labels, not guaranteed provider names.
- `PixPatch`: website-surface label; no public v2 `PixPatch` endpoint exists.
- `Pro`: a quality/tier label across many unrelated tools, not one endpoint or model. Treat Pro and Pro Tools routes as expensive unless current docs prove otherwise.
- `v3` and `new`: workflow/version labels scoped to a selected operation. Cheap-family hints, but check the endpoint — REST `inpaint-v3` is documented as Pro.
- `standard`: a legacy generation mode, not a quality tier (the `standard`/`pro` split on characters, tilesets). Use it only when the user explicitly asks or a route reference directs it.
- `S-XL`, `M-XL`, `S-M`, `M-L`: size/product labels, not asset intents.
- `Gemini`: a cost-tier label in current edit/inpaint schemas; its older website Create Tileset Pro usage is stale and must not be presented as current.

## Text Preparation

Exact field values win over prompt prep. If the user explicitly supplies a PixelLab-facing field value, such as `prompt: ...`, `description: ...`, `action: ...`, or `use exactly ...`, send that value unchanged and do not enhance it. If it is invalid, over limit, or unsafe, stop and ask for an approved replacement or trim before spending credits.

Prompt enhancement is opt-out. Otherwise, for natural-language parameters such as `description`, `style_description`, `negative_description`, `*_description`, `action`, `item_descriptions`, `text`, and `color_palette`, produce the best concise PixelLab-ready English value from the request and visible inputs before calling a tool. For non-English or mixed-language requests, load `references/localization.md` and obtain the user's approval for the exact English transformation before the first external call. Exception: `/talking-gif.text`, `/lip-sync.text`, and their MCP `text_to_speak` fields are dialogue content; preserve the user's wording exactly and do not enhance or translate it.

Prompts describe visual content or, for action fields, depicted motion — never tool operation, output metadata, or report status. Include only details that change output; omit boilerplate already expressed by a supported control. Prefer supported controls and positive structural wording. Use inline exclusions only for a specific visual constraint, not generic boilerplate; no separate field is required. On Pixen, describe the intended empty or replacement state instead of naming an otherwise absent object only to exclude it. Send `negative_description` only when the live schema exposes it. For a named visual style, state it briefly and avoid conflicting render adjectives; use route-specific references for additional style guidance.

Respect documented character limits: many REST v2 description fields allow 2000 characters, but several action/edit/style fields cap at 500. On a length rejection, trim without changing intent, note the adjustment, and retry. Exact limits: `references/prompt-limits.md` or OpenAPI.

Use one enhancement path per call. Inline `enhance_prompt` flags exist on `create-image-pixen`, `animate-with-text-v3`, `create-character-v3`, `animate-character`/`characters/animations`, and object animations, cost about 0.05 generations, and are preferred over a separate enhancer call when the route has one. Constraints: for character/object animation, `enhance_prompt` is valid only with `mode="v3"`; for `create-character-v3` it is valid only for from-scratch generation. These are REST-only fields — the matching MCP tools (`create_image_pixen`, `animate_image`, `create_character`) expose no `enhance_prompt`; on an MCP-first route, enhance directly as the agent instead. Standalone enhancers: `enhance-pixen-prompt` for Pixen image prompts, `enhance-animation-v3-prompt` for animation v3 actions, `enhance-character-v3-prompt` for character-v3 prompts. Otherwise enhance directly as the agent; do not force a mismatched enhancer.

## Do Not Use

- No local code or editor automation to create or alter requested visual content: no PIL/Pillow drawing, canvas/SVG drawing, ImageMagick draw, Aseprite Lua drawing, ASCII-to-image, or procedural pixel placement. Local code may copy, mask, composite, and verify pixels that came from PixelLab or the user.
- No undocumented internal endpoints used by first-party surfaces: root website routes, unversioned `https://api.pixellab.ai/` paths like `/tilesets/create`, or Aseprite extension operation URLs. Treat them as unsupported unless they appear in public REST v2 docs/OpenAPI or MCP docs.
- Never ask users to paste the PixelLab bearer token into chat; direct them to the setup wizard, local `PIXELLAB_SECRET`, or app secret settings.
- Never scrape browser session tokens or cookies. Website session tokens are not API bearer tokens; never use one for the other.
- Do not default to v1 or old SDK README examples for new work, and do not assume an installed SDK covers every current v2 endpoint — confirm the installed package or call REST v2 directly.

## Current Docs Refresh

Route from this skill first. Refresh official docs only when a needed tool, endpoint, field, schema, SDK detail, auth step, price/limit, or model/mode claim is missing or unclear. Start lightweight; fetch `openapi.json` only for exact schemas.

- `https://api.pixellab.ai/v2/llms.txt` — REST v2 endpoint index and auth summary
- `https://api.pixellab.ai/v2/docs` — interactive REST v2 parameters
- `https://api.pixellab.ai/v2/openapi.json` — exact schema checks only; read a field's existence, type, or default from the raw JSON, not a prose summary
- `https://api.pixellab.ai/mcp/docs` — MCP tool behavior
- `https://www.pixellab.ai/mcp` — MCP setup
- `https://github.com/pixellab-code` — official SDK/MCP repo state only
- `https://api.pixellab.ai/v1/openapi.json` — legacy checks only

If web access is unavailable, answer from this skill and say which current claim could not be freshly verified.

## Auth And Execution

If no bearer token is configured, stop before generation and offer the setup wizard: the user opens `https://www.pixellab.ai/account` after signing in, copies the value labeled `Secret`, and stores it locally as `PIXELLAB_SECRET` or in app secret settings — never pasted into chat. For Manual setup, link `https://www.pixellab.ai/mcp` and stop. PixelLab UI/docs may call this value an API key, API token, or secret; for REST/MCP bearer auth, call it a bearer token.

For questions, answer with: recommended surface/endpoint, why it fits, warnings for unsupported alternatives, and a verification note only when the answer depends on an unverified current fact.

For tasks, generate only when the user clearly requested it and token plus tooling are configured. For nontrivial work, produce one candidate first, report it, and continue only if asked. Before the first credit-spending call, apply the cost-approval gate in `references/auto.md`: unless the persistent `auto` setting is on, plan the whole paid chain, then in one message show every predicted paid call, its material inputs (including the exact prompt text), and a rough total for approval. For destructive remote actions, follow Destructive Remote Actions. Refuse unsupported automation and reroute to the closest documented MCP/REST option or a visible manual website flow. Locally authored non-PixelLab visual content requires explicit request or approval and a non-PixelLab-fallback label.

Capture a balance snapshot before a nontrivial paid call when available. After live PixelLab work, read `references/usage-reporting.md` and use its report layout; verify the output against the user's explicit constraints before calling it final, and say plainly when verification failed instead of silently salvaging. Do not paste secrets, raw base64, full response JSON, or internal IDs unless needed for pending status, follow-up, or debugging.

When a live generation, edit, transform, conversion, background-removal, or animation job returns image(s), read `references/bark.md` and apply the completion-sound contract.

## Examples

| Request | Route |
|---|---|
| "Make a wizard with idle and walk animations." | MCP `create_character`, then `animate_character`; `south` first, ask before all directions. |
| "Use the humanoid Walk (8 frames) template animation." | `references/preset-skeleton-template-animation.md`; MCP `animate_character` with `template_animation_id="walking-8-frames"`, REST `/characters/animations` fallback. |
| "Auto-rig this sprite and animate from the skeleton." | `references/preset-skeleton-template-animation.md`; REST `estimate-skeleton`, then `animate-with-skeleton`. |
| "Generate a mossy platformer tileset from code." | MCP `create_sidescroller_tileset`; REST v2 `create-tileset-sidescroller` for code/exact control or when MCP is unavailable. |
| "Make a 512x256 UI panel with a portrait circle and three buttons." | MCP `create_ui_asset` with `pieces`/`elements`; REST v2 `create-ui-asset` when `style_image`/`project_id` is needed or MCP is unavailable. |
| "Convert this image to pixel art and remove the background." | REST v2 `image-to-pixelart-pro`, then `remove-background`. |
| "Add a wind dash effect to this runner sprite." | MCP `edit_image` (pro) when MCP-first, else REST v2 `edit-image`; the runner is the edit target, effect on the same canvas. |
| "Give my character a leather helmet as a separate layer." | Paperdoll edit per `references/paperdolling.md`, not object generation. |
| "Use `/tilesets/create` with my browser token." | Refuse; route to public MCP/REST tileset tools or manual website use. |
| "What does Pro use?" | Product-level facts only; refresh official docs if current model details matter. |
| "Cheapest way to get a few item icons?" | `references/cost-routing.md` + `references/icon.md`; prefer a non-Pro route and name the tradeoff. |
| "Make a 30-second looping scene from this frame." | `references/cinematic.md`; ask for a budget if none given, decide cyclic vs evolving (one looped clip or chained shots), plan, validate each shot. |
